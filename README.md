# 1to2-converter

A converter for getting dialogic 1.x data working in dialogic 2. 

## Installation

You can download the repository and simply put the "Converter" folder into your dialogic extensions folder (can be configured in the dialogic general settings). After a restart of the engine, the Converter Page should appear in the settings.

- Within Dialogic, navigate to the settings panel, and see the converter on the left side submenu.
- Hit the "Verify Files" button to begin the process.  
- Once verified, "Begin Conversion" your files from the previous version.
- When the process finishes, temporarily switch away from the game engine and
- return to finalize the process and view the converted files.
- This ensures that the converted files become visible after the plugin operation.
